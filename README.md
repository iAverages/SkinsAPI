### Global info

All API requests are GET requests.  
:name - Can be a players username (iAverage) or UUID (1b8f18cf-7fb6-4a7a-8c25-c1ef296459f2) with or without dashes (-)  
If a invalid name or UUID is given, steve will be returned instead.  
The second layer of the skin is enabled by default and can be disabled by using the query string params `?overlay=false`
When a skin needs to be rechecked for updated, the api will return the skin in the cache. It will also begin to check for a updated skin.
